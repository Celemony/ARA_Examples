# ARA Audio Random Access: Examples

Copyright (c) 2012-2022, [Celemony Software GmbH](https://www.celemony.com), All Rights Reserved.
Published under the Apache 2.0 license.

The ARA_Examples Git repository contains various sample code demonstrating how to both implement
and host ARA enabled plug-ins. They are provided both as a mean to debug your implementation and
as a blueprint for building your own ARA applications.

Developers should use the [full ARA_SDK installer](https://github.com/Celemony/ARA_SDK) which
includes this repository along with the core ARA API specification, an extensive C++ library to ease
ARA development, and full documentation.

Any public release of ARA-enabled software should be based on a tagged public release of the ARA API.
If temporarily using HEAD to study current work-in-progress, keep in mind that in order to achieve a
concise long-term change history, any changes since the last tagged release may eventually be rebased.


## Companion APIs

Creating ARA-enabled products relies on using at least one of the various established audio plug-in
formats as "Companion APIs". The CMake code allows for setting path variables to your local copies
of these SDKs: `ARA_VST3_SDK_DIR` and `ARA_AUDIO_UNIT_SDK_DIR`. If needed, installing the SDKs
can be done using the [ARA SDK Installer](https://github.com/Celemony/ARA_SDK).


## 3rd party submodules

For generic tasks such as reading .wav files or applying Base64 encodings, some examples rely on
external dependencies, see separate [3rd party README](3rdParty/README.md). These dependencies
have separate licensing conditions as laid out in each project, but they should be fully compatible
with ARA's terms and conditions for typical use cases.

The external projects are integrated as shallow Git submodules. When using CMake these will be
automatically be fetched, otherwise this can be triggered explicitly with this Git command:

    git submodule update --init --recursive


## Examples overview

- Mini Host
The ARAMiniHost example is a very minimal ARA host application written using the pure C ARA API
that demonstrates the basic ARA plug-in life cycle in a host.

- Test Plug-In
This Audio Unit and VST3 plug-in utilizes the `ARAPlug` classes from the ARA library and can be
used as a template for creating ARA-enabled plug-ins. It executes a (fake) analysis of the audio
material including proper export of the resulting ARA content data and provides pass-through
ARA rendering and proper persistency.
It also features extensive validation and logging capabilities that make it very useful when
developing ARA host applications.
The actual plug-in is accompanied by a standalone ARATestChunkWriter tool for creating
ARA audio file chunks for the plug-in.

- Test Host
The ARATestHost is a command line utility that can be used to load and debug ARA plug-ins.
It implements many test scenarios that relate to real-life use cases.
Please see `main.cpp` for a description of its command line arguments and `TestCases.h`
for a list of tests that can be executed.
The ARATestHost also serves as a demonstration for how to implement the various
ARA hosting interfaces, and for how to load ARA enabled plug-ins using the VST3 or AudioUnit
companion APIs.
It also implements optionally running the plug-in in a separate address space, controlled via IPC.


## Building and running the examples

Building the ARA examples relies on CMake 3.12 or newer. Using CMake 3.19 or newer is highly
recommended, debugger support requires at least 3.13 for Visual Studio and 3.15 for Xcode.
To create a project for your development environment of choice, from within the ARA_Examples folder
execute this CMake command line (in older CMake versions, omit the whitespace after -B/-G/-A):

    cmake -B <desired output directory, e.g. ./build> -G <desired generator for your development environment, e.g. Xcode> -A <optional architecture>

This assume you've installed the companion API SDKs using the optional install scripts from the
ARA SDK installer. If you want to instead provide local copies of those SDKs, specify them like so:

    cmake -D ARA_VST3_SDK_DIR=/path/to/vst3sdk/ -D ARA_AUDIO_UNIT_SDK_DIR=/path/to/AudioUnit_SDK/ <then other arguments as shown above>

Note that while it is possible to directly open the ARA_Examples folder in Visual Studio 2017 or
newer utilizing its integrated CMake support, we still recommend creating an explicit solution due
to its superior project layout and debugger support, e.g. for VS2019:

    cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64

To properly handle signing and packaging on macOS, the CMake support is currently explicitly
limited to creating an Xcode project:

    cmake -G "Xcode" -B build

On Linux, the examples in general are still in an experimental state, but have been successfully
tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with GCC 8.3.0 and clang 7.0 using make as build system:

    cd ARA_SDK/ARA_Examples   # Enter the ARA_Examples directory
    mkdir build               # Create a CMake 'out of source' build directory
    cd build                  # Enter the build directory
    cmake ..                  # Execute cmake command to generate a GNU Makefile
    make                      # Compile the examples

To run the VST3 mini host (which automatically loads `ARATestPlugIn.vst3`), from within your build
directory execute:

    ./bin/Debug/ARAMiniHost

To run the test host example e.g. using the VST3 variant of the ARATestPlugIn:

    ./bin/Debug/TestHost -vst3 ARATestPlugIn.vst3

Or for the Audio Unit version on macOS:

    ./bin/Debug/TestHost -au aufx AraT ADeC

Or use the optional CLAP variant:

    ./bin/Debug/TestHost -clap ARATestPlugIn.clap 

To to run the plug-in in a separate process connected via IPC, use -ipc_vst3 or -ipc_au or
-ipc_clap instead of -vst3 or -au or -clap.

Where applicable (Visual Studio solution, Xcode project), debugging a plug-in target will per
default launch the validator application provided by the companion API. Debugging with the
ARATestHost will per default launch the SDK's ARATestPlugIn example in its VST3 incarnation.
Note that on macOS, debugging an Audio Unit with Apple's `auvaltool` might not be possible on your
machine due to System Integrity Protection. You will need to run `auvaltool` without attaching the
debugger in that case (by unchecking "Debug executable" in the scheme's "Run" tab).
